    <h1>What is MMM</h1>
    <br>

    <h3>Attention! First of all, make sure to read the warnings! </h3>

    <p><b>MMM</B> is not a bank, has no central account, does not collect your MONEY; MMM is not an online business, an investment or a sales program. It is neither a company, nor an enterprise. There is no boss, no owner, no office space, no formal organization, no legal entity, no business, no investment or no other activities of any form. MMM is a community where people help each other. Here, people provide help free of charge, and are absolutely conscious to remit to each other directly, from one account to another, for direct currency exchange; all funds are circulated among participants; no intermediary or intermediate link can touch the money. Only millions of common participants remit for providing help through personal account. Only with good will, one person provides help to another person in need of help, absolute free of charge. Today you help others, and tomorrow others will help you. Just no more!

 

        MMM provides technology and basic course and helps millions of global participants in need of help and those who are ready to provide help. Blockchain smart contract system only plays the role of dispatcher matching supply and demand. It only connects those who want to provide help and those who want to get help.
        
         
        
        MMM is a community where common people help each other. It is a global mutual aid fund. People provide financial assistant to each other on the principle of free charge, selflessness, mutual benefit and mercy. In MMM system, you do not need to sign a contract or mortgage properties and there is no creditor or obligor, everything is simple: One participant asks for help, while another one capable provides help. The only requirement of MMM for participants is honest and kind to each other. When you need financial assistance, you applies for help; when you are able to provide help, you do. In transactions, participants use dollar-anchored cryptocurrency for transfer. This is the best method for participants of different countries to make smooth remittance. </p>

   <h3>How does MMM work?</h3>
   <p>Now, let’s see an example. If you want to provide the help of $ 100 to another community member in need, there are two big buttons on the home page: “Provide help” and “Get help”, and please click “Provide help” to input the help amount to generate an order. MMM system would match a community participant in need of help; you transfer to the participant by paying the help amount. Just in this way, you can finish the whole process of providing help. In your “User Center”, you will get the reward of 100 Mavro and the reward would grow immediately! Your Mavro will grow at 1% per day, up to 30% monthly; just in a month, the initial 100 Mavro will grow into 130 Mavro. However, this does not need to wait a month; by the 15th day, you may apply for getting help from others; just by clicking “Get help” on the home page of MMM system, you would get financial assistance from other participants in the world. Just like you did, they transfer the money to you; just in this way, you turn your Mavro of MMM system into the fund needed for your daily life. The operation is simple and you will be clear just after one use. This model allows each participant to cast off the slaved money-making life! </p>

<h3>Important!</h3>
<p>MMMDAPP Decentralized Blockchain Smart Contract is to write the traditional contract terms into the blockchain in the form of code. The contract mechanism is code, namely law of the system. Once participants trigger certain terms of the contract, the contract code will be automatically executed, completely independent of any person’s control. It is hard for breach of contract. The code does not know who you are, and it has no emotion or interest relationship. As long as you meet its conditions, it will be executed immediately. Blockchain smart contract does not need mutual trust because it is enforced by code and is completely free from any human factors controlling its execution. Blockchain contract mechanism and data can't be tempered with. It is fair, just, open and transparent, and everybody can trace blockchain data. Its operation is not affected by the control of any centralized administrator. </p>
<br><p>The Decentralized Blockchain Smart Contract of MMMDAPP is more honest than any bank or any licensed financial institution (by 100 times)! There will be no trick or cheat here, any more! This is a real global mutual aid fund where the system belongs to participants wholly and participants also constitute the system. The system only plays the role of dispatcher matching supply and demand. It only provides the matching operation between help provider and help needer, and it only connects those who want to provide help and those who need help. The blockchain technology revolution not only brings light to the world where there is fraud, but also subverts the dishonest and violating phenomena that are caused by the centralized model of traditional financial and banking industry. The Decentralized Blockchain Smart Contract System eliminates the natural contradiction between participants and administrators fundamentally, reestablishes the trust mechanism of financial banking and reshapes the global centralized financial order. </p>
   <br><br><p>Warning! MMM is neither investment, nor business. Money received from MMM system shall not be regarded as an income, but help from global participants. Participants help each other, remit directly, have no intermediary; very simple and clear. No one promises or warrants to pay it! Even if you follow all the instructions, you may possibly lose all the money; no reason or explanation; the only rule is no rule. Always remember it! Only use non-critical reserve fund when you join the system or never join it, Amen. (Before you join, make sure to read our thoughts and warnings!)</p>

    II. Rules for MMMDAPP Jackpot Funds
    
    When markets are weak and funds are scarce, the jackpot fund system makes the last batch of help providers get 2 to 10 times of yield each as permanent winners, which upends the institutional flaw that traditional institutions are unfair to the latecomers and avoids the ultimate problem that all systems cause the latecomers’ losses. The jackpot funds give the market the permanent confidence and motive force, and provide the continuous life energy for the long-term stable operation of the system.
    
    2% of all order amount go into the Jackpot Funds. The Jackpot Funds is divided into large and small Jackpot Funds, with 1.5% as the big Jackpot fund (0.8% award fund, 0.5% refund fund, 0.2% preparatory award fund for next round); 0.5% as small jackpot fund(0.5% of the daily order amount as the lucky draw bonus for the day).
    
    Explanation of the countdown to the big jackpot： If the application for GH (Get help) order has not been matched for more than 7 days, the contract code will automatically trigger the jackpot competition mechanism. The countdown will begin from the last 24 hours. When the countdown begins, with each help of 100 USDT paid to the account, the countdown will be increased by 15 seconds. And the maximum countdown can be increased to up to 24 hours and will no longer be increased then. When the countdown is 00:00:00, the jackpot will be unveiled. Applications for PH/GH will be stopped, the system will enter a 72-hour pause mode, the financial data will be frozen and transferred to the new system after the restart.
    
    Explanation of the countdown to the lottery：The drawing will be made at 15:00 each day according to Russian time. For each 100USDT input, the participant can get a 5-digit random number automatically generated by the block chain smart contract. When it reaches the daily lottery drawing time, the smart contract will automatically generate a 5-digit random number, and the participant can win if his/her number conforms to the rules.
    Rules for jackpot funds;
    
    1)The jackpot fund 0.8%：When the countdown is 00：00：00, the jackpot fund will start to be allocated to the last batch of help providers. In reverse order of payment transfer time, the last 1-10 payments will be rewarded with 10 times of their payment amount, the 2-11 payment transfers from bottom get paid with 5 times the amount as rewards, the 12-51 payment transfers from bottom get paid with 3 times the amount as rewards, other payment transfers get 2 times the amount as rewards, until all the jackpot funds is allocated.
    
    2) The fund of refund 0.5%： After the allocation of the jackpot funds, help providers who haven't won the jackpot funds will continue to be allocated with the funds of refund in the reverse order of time for their payment and transfer, with 100% of the help amount returned, until the funds of refund have been allocated wholly.
    
    3) The preparatory jackpot 0.2%： When the system starts a new cycle after the restart, the preparatory jackpot starts and provides life energy for the market vitality after the restart.
    
     
    Rules for lottery funds;
    
    The first prize pool amount is 30% : all the figures are in line with the drawing figures, and the maximum value of each is 10000USDT.
    
    The second prize pool amount is 30% : the last four digits are in line with the drawing number, and the maximum amount for each is 3000USDT.
    
    The third prize pool amount is 40% : the last three digits are in line with the drawing number, and the maximum is 500USDT.
    
    The prize money on the day shall be drawn according to the maximum bonus amount of the prize pool. If the bonus pool is insufficient, the prize money shall be shared on the average. If there is surplus in the pool, it will be accumulated to the next day.
    
    One 5-digit number can only redeem the prize once, prize level match from top to bottom.
    
    For example, if the daily prize pool has 100000USDT, then the prize money allocation will be first prize pool 30000USDT, second prize pool 30000USDT, and third prize pool 40000USDT.
    
    If only one person wins the first prize today, the prize will be 10000USDT, and the remaining 20000U will be accumulated to next day. If there are 5 people who win the first prize today, the prize will be 6000USDT (30000/5 =6000USDT). The calculation logic of the second and third prizes is the same as the first prize.

The Mavro Commemorative Tokens that have not been destroyed will be in circulation forever.
